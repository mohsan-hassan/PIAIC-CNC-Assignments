                    <b>What it’s about:</b> If you associate portfolios with a dry list of facts,
                    this portfolio might surprise you. Robby found a novel way of
                    displaying what was otherwise dry information — he laid out his
                    portfolio site as a videogame that the visitor can actually play. This
                    incredibly fun interactive design portfolio will make you scroll
